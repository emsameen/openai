Creating test cases using Cucumber and Gherkin for defined requirements involves writing specifications in a structured format that both non-technical stakeholders and developers can understand. Although Cucumber is primarily oriented towards languages like Ruby, Java, and JavaScript, you can use it alongside C++ with the help of certain integrations or tools.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to creating test cases, along with an example:

### Step 1: Define Your Requirements

First, you should have clear, defined requirements that you want to test. For this example, let's consider a simple requirement for a calculator application that adds two numbers.

### Requirement
- **The calculator should correctly add two numbers.**

### Step 2: Write Gherkin Scenarios

Using Gherkin syntax, you can write scenarios that define how the feature should behave. A Gherkin file usually has a `.feature` extension.

**Example of a Gherkin feature file (`calculator.feature`):**

```gherkin
Feature: Addition

  Scenario: Add two positive numbers
    Given I have the number 5
    And I have the number 10
    When I add the two numbers
    Then the result should be 15

  Scenario: Add a negative number and a positive number
    Given I have the number -3
    And I have the number 7
    When I add the two numbers
    Then the result should be 4
```

### Step 3: Implement Step Definitions

In the step definitions, you associate each Gherkin step with C++ code that performs the necessary actions.

This normally requires a C++ testing framework, and there are several options such as Catch2. However, for Cucumber with C++, you might use different bridges or libraries. Below is an illustrative implementation assuming you have the necessary integration set up.

**Example C++ Implementation:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

class Calculator {
public:
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};

// Step Definitions
// Using pseudo-code to represent steps
int number1, number2, result;

Given("I have the number {int}", [&](int num) {
    number1 = num;
});

Given("I have the number {int}", [&](int num) {
    number2 = num;
});

When("I add the two numbers", [&]() {
    Calculator calculator;
    result = calculator.add(number1, number2);
});

Then("the result should be {int}", [&](int expected) {
    if (result != expected) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Test failed: expected " + std::to_string(expected) + " but got " + std::to_string(result));
    }
});
```

### Step 4: Running the Tests

To run the tests, you would typically have a runner or a command line instruction that points to your Cucumber setup and executes the scenarios defined in your `.feature` files.

### Summary
1. Define your requirements clearly.
2. Create a Gherkin feature file with scenarios using Given, When, Then syntax.
3. Implement step definitions in C++ to execute the scenarios.
4. Run your tests to validate the implementation.

This structured approach allows collaboration among technical and non-technical team members while ensuring that the application meets the desired requirements properly.

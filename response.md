Certainly, Developer! Below, I'll define some testing scenarios using Cucumber and Gherkin for the given requirements and provide C++ test code snippets using the Google Test framework.

### Cucumber and Gherkin Scenarios

**Feature: Brake Light Control Based on Acceleration**

```gherkin
Feature: Brake Light Control
  As a vehicle control system
  I want to control the brake light based on acceleration data
  So that drivers are aware of deceleration events

  Scenario: Turn ON brake light on deceleration
    Given the vehicle is receiving acceleration data
    When the average acceleration over the last 5 seconds is -3 m/s²
    Then the brake light should be ON

  Scenario: Turn OFF brake light on no deceleration
    Given the vehicle is receiving acceleration data
    When the average acceleration over the last 5 seconds is -1 m/s²
    Then the brake light should be OFF

  Scenario: Handle invalid acceleration data
    Given the vehicle is receiving acceleration data
    When the received data is invalid
    Then the brake light should maintain its current state

  Scenario: Maintain brake light state on insufficient data
    Given the vehicle is receiving acceleration data
    When the historical data is insufficient due to missing inputs
    And the most recent valid acceleration is -2 m/s²
    Then the brake light should turn OFF

  Scenario: Update historical data with latency
    Given the vehicle is receiving acceleration data
    When a new acceleration is received
    Then the historical data should update within 50 milliseconds
```

### C++ Tests Using Google Test Framework

Here are some C++ test cases that map to the scenarios defined above:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <vector>
#include <stdexcept>

class BrakeLightController {
public:
    void receiveAccelerationData(float acceleration);
    bool isBrakeLightOn() const;

private:
    std::vector<float> accelerationHistory;
    const int WINDOW_SIZE = 5; // in seconds
    const float DECELERATION_THRESHOLD_ON = -2.5f;
    const float DECELERATION_THRESHOLD_OFF = -2.5f;

    void updateBrakeLightState();
    bool validData(float data);
};

// Implementation of methods would go here...

TEST(BrakeLightControllerTest, TurnONBrakeLightOnDeceleration) {
    BrakeLightController controller;

    // Simulate receiving acceleration data
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        controller.receiveAccelerationData(-3.0);
    }

    EXPECT_TRUE(controller.isBrakeLightOn());
}

TEST(BrakeLightControllerTest, TurnOFFBrakeLightOnNoDeceleration) {
    BrakeLightController controller;

    // Simulate receiving acceleration data
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        controller.receiveAccelerationData(-1.0);
    }

    EXPECT_FALSE(controller.isBrakeLightOn());
}

TEST(BrakeLightControllerTest, HandleInvalidAccelerationData) {
    BrakeLightController controller;

    // Simulate valid and invalid data
    controller.receiveAccelerationData(-2.0);
    EXPECT_FALSE(controller.isBrakeLightOn());

    // Simulate invalid data input
    ASSERT_THROW(controller.receiveAccelerationData(NAN), std::invalid_argument);
    EXPECT_FALSE(controller.isBrakeLightOn()); // Maintain state
}

TEST(BrakeLightControllerTest, MaintainStateOnInsufficientData) {
    BrakeLightController controller;

    // Simulate valid acceleration data
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        controller.receiveAccelerationData(-2.0); // Insufficient data
    }
    
    EXPECT_FALSE(controller.isBrakeLightOn());
}

TEST(BrakeLightControllerTest, HistoricalDataUpdateLatency) {
    BrakeLightController controller;

    // We would need to measure time, but for simplicity, we will just simulate calls
    controller.receiveAccelerationData(-2.7);
    // Assuming here we'd measure the time it takes to update - omitted for simplicity.
    EXPECT_TRUE(controller.isBrakeLightOn());
}

// Main function to run tests
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Notes:

1. The actual implementation of methods in `BrakeLightController`, such as `receiveAccelerationData` and `updateBrakeLightState`, is not provided. You need to implement these methods to ensure the class functions according to requirements.
2. The tests handle expected behavior based on the requirements and scenarios defined.
3. Error handling such as throwing exceptions for invalid input is also demonstrated in the tests.
4. More tests can be added for edge cases based on how you decide to implement the class methods.

Feel free to expand on these tests or scenarios as needed, Developer!
